# SmartpassApp
Smartpass App was a school assignment with OsloMet - Storbyuniversitet for the course ADTS - Webprosjekt. This is the 2nd assignment in the first year and schoo semester and is representing the beginning of the coding journey with basic HTML and CSS.. Smartpass app is a Ski keycard application that was conceptualized, and prototyped as included on the webpage. It was a group effort, which was graded with an A, which is why the source coded is shared on github, as part of a portfolio.
